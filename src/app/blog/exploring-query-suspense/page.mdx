React [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) is a novel mechanism
to display a loading fallback and suspend rendering content while some async task
is pending.

Various data fetching libraries have built-in support for suspense and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/suspense)
is one of those libraries.

However it is not very well known how to use suspense with React Query and what
are the best practices for doing so. Suspense for data fetching has been around
quite a long time but it has not gained much popularity due to being considered
somewhat experimental and not "production ready".

Recently with RSC getting more stable and React introducing suspense-aware APIs
like [startTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition),
[useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition), and [useDeferredValue](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue)
it is now a good time to revisit suspense for data fetching and see how it can
be used with React Query.

In this article I will describe my exploration of trying to use suspense with
React Query and what issues I encountered and how I solved them.

## React Query without Suspense

Before we dive into the details of using suspense with React Query let's first
see how most devs fetch data with React Query without suspense.

The default non-suspense way to fetch data with React Query looks something like the following:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function Example() {
  const { data, isLoading, isError, isFetching } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos"],
    queryFn: fetchTodos,
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <div>Something went wrong</div>;
  }

  if (!data || data.length === 0) {
    return <div>No todos found</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>

      {isFetching && <p>Fetching...</p>}

      <ul>
        {data.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This should look familiar to you if you have used React Query before - at least
most projects I've worked on fetch data this way.

This is all good and well but it can get somewhat laborious to keep track of all
the different states of the query in your component.

All hooks and functions within the component need be aware of the potentially
non-existent data which can result into many `if (data)` or `data.?`
(or god forbid `data!.someField` 😱) checks and annotations in your code making
it harder to understand.

Additionally TypeScript doesn't automatically infer that the data is defined
if you only check for loading and error states. You still need to manually
check that the data is not `undefined` or use the `isSuccess` flag.

```tsx
function Example() {
  const { data, isSuccess } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos"],
    queryFn: fetchTodos,
  });

  // This hook has to be aware that data is possibly undefined
  const something = useSomething(data?.someField);

  function handleSomething() {
    // Guard against data being undefined
    if (!data) return;
  }

  // Bail out if data is not defined
  if (!data) return null;

  // Or check `isSuccess` flag
  if (!isSuccess) return null;

  // Now you can use data without TS complaining...
}
```

You can quite easily get around these challenges by moving all functions, hooks,
and JSX that depend on the data into a separate component and only render it when
the data is available.

However my experience is that most devs don't do this and end up
putting way too much logic into the same component that has the query.
This usually makes the code quite messy and hard to maintain.

## Using Suspense

Suspense provides an alternative way to handle these states. It enables us to
suspend rendering a view until all of its queries have completed.
This is very powerful when you have multiple queries in a view and want to
delegate showing a loading indicator and error handling to a shared place above
the component tree.

React Query has built-in support for Suspense via the [useSuspenseQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useSuspenseQuery) hook.
When you use a suspended version of a query it will always have its data defined
and when initially the query is loading the data it will suspend and delegate
the loading and error views to the closest boundary component.

Here's how it looks to use a suspended query:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos"],
    queryFn: fetchTodos,
  });

  if (data.length === 0) {
    return <div>No todos found</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

See! No need to handle loading or error states in the component itself!
And the data is always defined so TypeScript won't complain about it possibly being undefined. 🎉

You need to have a suspense and an error boundary somewhere above in the component
tree in order to show a fallback while the data is being fetched and to handle
any errors that might occur.

```tsx
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

function Parent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong!</div>}>
        <Example />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

This setup is the basis for using suspense for data fetching and it works great
for simple cases where you only load the data once and don't need to refetch it
with different query keys.

> 💡 Tip: See React Query docs for adding a [QueryErrorResetBoundary](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryErrorResetBoundary)
> next to the main [ErrorBoundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) component.

But what if you want to refetch the data when the query key changes?

By default suspense-enabled hooks like `useSuspenseQuery` will re-suspend the component
when the query key changes, eg. when you change pagination, sorting, or some other filter parameter,
causing the suspense boundary fallback to be displayed. This is not optimal and causes a bad UX for users.

We can get around this default behaviour by utilising some additional suspense-aware features from React.

## Deferring Suspense

React has two ways to stop the default behaviour of suspense: `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`.

> ⚠️ Note: The first method with `useTransition` is not recommended in vast majority of cases!
> However, it is important to know that it exists and it can be used when deferring the whole
> query with `useDeferredValue` is not feasible.

### Deferring with useTransition

The first hook `useTransition` can be used to mark any state update as non-urgent
which will tell React to keep showing the current UI while the component is “transitioning“
via suspense into the new version of the UI. React will basically render the new
UI in the background and replace the old UI only after the new UI is completely ready
(eg. query has fetched new data with new query key).

Here's an example that prevents suspension with `useTransition`:

```tsx
import { useTransition, useState } from "react";
import { useSuspenseQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function Example() {
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos", page],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos({ page }),
  });

  function handleNextPage() {
    startTransition(() => {
      setPage((prev) => prev + 1);
    });
  }

  function handlePrevPage() {
    startTransition(() => {
      setPage((prev) => prev - 1);
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <p>Fetching...</p>}

      <ul>{/* ...render todos... */}</ul>

      <button onClick={handlePrevPage}>Previous</button>
      <button onClick={handleNextPage}>Next</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now if the user updates the pagination page we wrap the related state setter in
`startTransition` to tell React that we don't want to show the suspense fallback
but instead keep showing the old UI while the query is fetching new data.

The `useTransition` hook returns `isPending` variable that can be used to show an
inline loading indicator to tell the user that new data is being fetched.
This is much better than having the whole UI being replaced with the suspense fallback - nice! 👌

However, there is one major downside with this approach: **we need wrap every query
related state setter in startTransition!**

This can be cumbersome to do and in some cases you might not have access to the
state setter function if it is hidden behind a 3rd party component.

Another problem is that the pending state is co-located with the state setter
instead of with the query. This becomes especially problematic when you use the
URL as the source of truth for your query parameters and you have multiple
components that update different parts of the URL.

For example:

```tsx
import { useTransition } from 'react';
import { useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { useSuspenseQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function Sidebar() {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleProjectSelect(id: string) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setSearchParams((params) => {
        params.set("project", id);
        return params;
      });
    });
  }

  return (
    /* ...render list of projects... */
  );
}

function Search() {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleInputChange(value) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setSearchParams((params) => {
        if (value) {
          params.set('search', value);
        } else {
          params.delete('search');
        }
        return params;
      });
    });
  }

  return (
    /* ...render search input... */
  );
}

function Table() {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const search = searchParams.get('search') || '';
  const project = searchParams.get('project');

  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos", search, project],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos({ search, project }),
  });

  return (
    /* ...render table... */
  );
}

function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Sidebar />
      <Search />
      <Table />
    </>
  );
}
```

Each of these components are encapsulated and they simply update some URL parameter
which then triggers a query to be refetched in a different component when new
params are received via React Router's [useSearchParams](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-search-params) hook.

The component that has the query would in this case have no way to show an inline
loading indicator as the pending state lives in other components that have the
`useTransition` hook.

So, you should only utilise `useTransition` with suspense when you want to choose
case-by-case whether to wrap a state setter with `startTransition` or not.

As stated in the premise of this article: **in most cases you however always want
to avoid showing the suspense boundary fallback after the initial load.**

This is where the `useDeferredValue` hook comes into play.

### Deferring with useDeferredValue

So how can we make a query that only shows the suspense fallback on initial load?

This behaviour can be accomplished with the help of `useDeferredValue` by creating
a “deferred” version of the `queryKey` parameter. The deferred query will hold on
to its previous value until the data has loaded and the UI will show the stale data
for a moment.

Let's make a custom hook to accomplish this:

```tsx
import { useDeferredValue } from "react";
import { useSuspenseQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function useSuspenseQueryDeferred(options) {
  const deferredQueryKey = useDeferredValue(options.queryKey);

  const isSuspending = options.queryKey !== deferredQueryKey;

  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    ...options,
    queryKey: deferredQueryKey,
  });

  return { ...query, isSuspending };
}
```

By using our custom `useSuspenseQueryDeferred` hook instead of the default
`useSuspenseQuery` hook we get exactly what we outlined before: the component
suspends on initial load and shows the loading fallback but on subsequent fetches
the component can use the `isSuspending` flag to show an inline loading indicator.

However there is one small issue: `useDeferredValue` compares the old and the new
value it receives with [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)
which means that the `isSuspending` value will change on every re-render as
React Query uses arrays as the value of `queryKey`. This array is re-created on
each render, even though its actual content doesn't change, meaning is is referentially different.

So, we need to get a stable reference for the `queryKey` in order to make things
work correctly. This can be achieved by doing a deep comparison based memoization like so:

```tsx
import { useDeferredValue } from "react";
import { useSuspenseQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useDeepCompareMemo } from "use-deep-compare";

export function useSuspenseQueryDeferred(options) {
  const queryKey = useDeepCompareMemo(
    () => options.queryKey,
    [options.queryKey]
  );

  const deferredQueryKey = useDeferredValue(queryKey);

  const isSuspending = queryKey !== deferredQueryKey;

  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    ...options,
    queryKey: deferredQueryKey,
  });

  return { ...query, isSuspending };
}
```

Now the `queryKey` array has a stable reference and it only changes when the
actual content of the array changes.

Let's see how we can use our custom `useSuspenseQueryDeferred` hook in a component:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);

  const { data, isSuspending } = useSuspenseQueryDeferred({
    queryKey: ["todos", search, project],
    queryFn: () => fetchTodos({ search, project }),
  });

  function handleNextPage() {
    setPage((prev) => prev + 1);
  }

  function handlePrevPage() {
    setPage((prev) => prev - 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isSuspending && <p>Fetching...</p>}

      <ul>{/* ...render todos... */}</ul>

      <button onClick={handlePrevPage}>Previous</button>
      <button onClick={handleNextPage}>Next</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

See now we don't need to utilise `useTransition` anymore. We can just update the
state normally and the query will automatically handle deferring the suspension,
and it provides us a `isSuspending` flag which we can use to show an inline
loading indicator.

Pretty neat, huh? 🤩

### Adding types

The final version of our custom `useSuspenseQueryDeferred` hook with all the
fancy TypeScript types looks like this:

```tsx
import { useDeferredValue } from "react";
import { useDeepCompareMemo } from "use-deep-compare";

import {
  DefaultError,
  QueryKey,
  UseSuspenseQueryOptions,
  useSuspenseQuery,
} from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function useSuspenseQueryDeferred<
  TQueryFnData = unknown,
  TError = DefaultError,
  TData = TQueryFnData,
  TQueryKey extends QueryKey = QueryKey,
>(options: UseSuspenseQueryOptions<TQueryFnData, TError, TData, TQueryKey>) {
  const queryKey = useDeepCompareMemo(
    () => options.queryKey,
    [options.queryKey]
  );

  const deferredQueryKey = useDeferredValue(queryKey);

  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    ...options,
    queryKey: deferredQueryKey,
  });

  const isSuspending = queryKey !== deferredQueryKey;

  return { ...query, isSuspending };
}
```

Feel free to copy this hook to your project and start using suspense with React Query!

## Summary

Using Suspense for data fetching allows you to delegate loading indicators and
error handling to a shared place in a component tree making the data fetching
related logic in components much simpler.

React Query has built-in support for Suspense but it has some limitations that
can be overcome by using either `useTransition` or `useDeferredValue` hooks.

It is important to know that suspense based data fetching might not be
a good fit in all situations. A good example where suspense doesn't make sense is
an autocomplete input (aka combobox) where the results are dynamically loaded
based on user's input.

Also if you want to have more granular loading indicators and error handling you
might not want to use suspense. Additionally, if you have below-the-fold content
or otherwise initially non-visible content (like modals) that dynamically load
data on demand (eg. when modal is opened) you probably should not use suspense for those.

> 💁‍♂️ **A good rule of thumb is that suspense for data fetching should only be used for non-dependant data that is rendering-critical.** - Meaning any data that is not dependant on other data (to avoid fetch waterfalls) and is required to render a given view in a functionally complete state.

## Extra tip - improved spinners 🌀

There is one more thing you can do to improve the user experience when using
suspense for data fetching: delay showing the loading indicator for a short period
of time to avoid flashing the spinner for very fast queries.

We can bake this behaviour into our custom `useSuspenseQueryDeferred` hook by
utilising the [spin-delay](https://github.com/smeijer/spin-delay) library:

```tsx
import { useDeferredValue } from "react";
import { useDeepCompareMemo } from "use-deep-compare";
import { useSpinDelay } from "spin-delay";

import {
  DefaultError,
  QueryKey,
  UseSuspenseQueryOptions,
  useSuspenseQuery,
} from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function useSuspenseQueryDeferred<
  TQueryFnData = unknown,
  TError = DefaultError,
  TData = TQueryFnData,
  TQueryKey extends QueryKey = QueryKey,
>(options: UseSuspenseQueryOptions<TQueryFnData, TError, TData, TQueryKey>) {
  const queryKey = useDeepCompareMemo(
    () => options.queryKey,
    [options.queryKey]
  );

  const deferredQueryKey = useDeferredValue(queryKey);

  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    ...options,
    queryKey: deferredQueryKey,
  });

  // 👇 Update this 👇
  const isSuspending = useSpinDelay(queryKey !== deferredQueryKey);

  return { ...query, isSuspending };
}
```

Now when using our custom hook the loading indicator will only be shown after
a small delay and it will be shown for a minimum amount of time to avoid unwanted
UI flickering.

Nobody likes flickering spinners, right? 😵‍💫
